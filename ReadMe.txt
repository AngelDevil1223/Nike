Setup:

First of all, you need to open 10 chrome at different locations and visit nike.com and browse the site as a normal user.
You can run the Bot batch script first and the bot will open 10 chrome instances in container folder.
Install the CORS Unblock and TamperMonkey and activate it on all 10 chromes. Upload the scripts to Tampermonkey and enable it.
Change the download location of 10 chromes to tmp folder.
Run the Bot batch script to start the bot.


Extra: Now, the bot can save phone number also in txt file. It'll only save the data after phone verification SUCCESS (including registration and phone).
It'll also send you email:password on discord server after success.
The bot will wait 1 minute then request to get sms code.
The bot can logout the account and can close the chrome on unsuccessful registration.
