NIKE BOT - Verified

The complete workflow including phone verification is working fine.


All in One TXT File:

There is no way because Javascript running with client side can't interact with system filing so you can't read/write files with JS.
But, I already created a method to save data.
Regarding all in one data file, I've created a powershell script which will merge all the data in tmp folder and creates all in one data file.

When you finish your bot, you can execute merge.ps1. Just right click on merge executable and click 'Run as Powershell'.
It'll merge all the records in the current dir tmp folder and make the new file as data.txt in the root folder and deletes all the garbage files in tmp folder.


Extra Info:

You can feel free to try to open multiple chrome instances or multiple windows and run the bot.

Thank You!
